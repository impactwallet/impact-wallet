# Equity

Why did we start thinking about equity as a game-changer element?

# Vision

People  (not companies) build greate products, houses, ships, aircrafts, grow food and and so on. People's work makes companies’ owners rich and powerful.  But it would be fair to make results of people's efforts working on them.

This is the qoute from "_Les Miserables_", Victor Hugo (1862)
> All the problems that the socialists proposed to themselves,
cosmogonic visions, revery and mysticism being cast aside, can be
reduced to two principal problems.

> First problem: To produce wealth.
> Second problem: To share it.

> The first problem contains the question of work.
> The second contains the question of salary.

> In the first problem the employment of forces is in question.
> In the second, the distribution of enjoyment.

> From the proper employment of forces results public power.

> From a good distribution of enjoyments results individual
happiness.

> By a good distribution, not an equal but an equitable distribution must be understood.
From these two things combined, the public power without, individual happiness within, results social prosperity.

> Social prosperity means the man happy, the citizen free, the nation great.

> England solves the first of these two problems. She creates wealth admirably, she divides it badly.

> This solution which is complete on one side only leads her fatally to two extremes: monstrous opulence, monstrous wretchedness.

> in two words, **learn how to produce wealth and how to distribute it, and you will have at once moral
and material greatness;**

Now we have Economy working like England centuries ago.

But we have everything to build a new model relevant the one that great minds already formulated in the Age of Enlightement.

We just need to add the second part (fair wealth distribution) to this formula of having moral and material greatness. That is why We should turn Economy into Impactonomy.

# Solution
We use blockchain technology and smart contracts to make the idea of equity-based collaboration possible.

# How to calculate Impact your contribution made?

To measure and differentiate Impact of each contribution we use Impact Ratio. The Impact Ratio helps to account ‘the power of influence’ of members contributed the same amount of time.

Member’s dividends is calculated based on their Equity. Every member’s Equity is calculated based on Impact Shares. Impact Shares are earned multiplying time member spent to contribute by their Impact Ratio.

# The future of work

Just imagine that everyone can set up their own business this way: 
When someone pays for a product or service provided by your Impact Organization every contributor inevitably gets dividends pro-rata their Equity.
