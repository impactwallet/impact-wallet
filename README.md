Why did we start thinking about a new model of distribution of the Internet wealth?

We heard about the problem of "Original sin of the Internet" from a fireside chat between Katie Haun and Marc Andreessen (co-founder of [a16z](https://a16z.com))

Just listent to this 2min problem explenation:

In short: Marc Andreessen has inventented a browser (Netscape) and didn't manage to build payments natively into the browser. He tried to do that but back in that days there weren't much trust to the Internet from the payment systems and banks.

So the Advertising became as a primary business model in the Internet and this led to:
* Privacy nightmare
* Tracknig users
* Selling users data
* Awful [user experience](https://how-i-experience-web-today.com/detail.html)
* Growig surface content vs meaningful content
* Enrichment of platforms and undermonetizing developers and content creators 

# Goals: 
* Solve copyright issues
* Build a fair distribution of the Internet wealth
